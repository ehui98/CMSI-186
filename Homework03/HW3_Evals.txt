Elizabeth -- I'm not sure what happened here... you only have the "Die.java"
file in your repo.  Did you just forget to upload the other files?  If you
have them and will upload them, I'll evaluate them.

If you are stuck or don't understand some of the material, please feel free
to come by during either office hours or during the "HOPE" session which is
on Wednesday at noon in the regular classroom [Keck Lab Annex].
